Introduction
The ambiguity of quantity expressions, such as many in (1), is
traditionally identified as the distinction between ‘weak’ and ‘strong’
determiners, e.g. Milsark 1977, Barwise and Cooper 1981, Partee 1989,
Bowers 1991.
(1) Many men are in the garden. Bowers 1991: 26
 (i) weak: ‘there are many men in the garden’
 (ii) strong: ‘of the existing men, a large proportion are in the garden’
The weak many is argued to have a cardinal reading, as in (2-a), which
states that the cardinality of the intersection of a set of men and a set of
entities in the garden is a large number. The strong many, on the other
hand, has a proportional reading, as in (2-b), which states that the
percentage of the men in the garden relative to the set of men is large.
Both these readings are vague, in the sense that what counts as a large
number or percentage depends on the context.
