In Search of Reference
The case of the Russian adjectival intensifier samyj

This dissertation is a multilayered exploration of the structure of the Determiner Phrase
(DP) and the nature of reference in natural language. At the most basic empirical level,
it is a case study of the intensifying adjective samyj ‘self’ in Russian. This phenomenon
is understudied and is usually taken to be subsumed under the more general study of
modification by emphatic pronouns, such as himself in English or sam in Russian. The
general outcome of this case study is that intensification by samyj and sam are two
di↵erent phenomena in Russian and analyzing samyj in terms of sam misses important
generalizations about the structure and functioning of DPs. Three main constructions are
examined, in which samyj is used with (a) demonstratives (Dem+samyj), (b) pronouns
(Pron+samyj), and (c) gradable properties to form superlatives (self -superlatives).
