AIL is a series of annual interdisciplinary workshops on Agency and Intentions in Language. The goal of these workshops is to bring together scholars in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, and other disciplines who are interested in questions related to agency, intentions, reasoning about actions, and causation, broadly construed.
